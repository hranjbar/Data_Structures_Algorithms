'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of 
the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element
is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is 
outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
